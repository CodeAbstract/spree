## About Spree

Spree Commerce is an open-source eCommerce framework giving you full control and customizability. &#x20;

Spree is being used by thousands of businesses around the world.&#x20;

## Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition

Spree also comes as an Enterprise Edition with more features, more security, more integrations enabling you to go live faster and get all the latest improvements first. So what sets both versions apart?

To help you pick the right solution for your project weâ€™ll shortly summarize the key differences between the Community Edition (free license & open-source) and the Enterprise Edition (paid license & source-available) of Spree Commerce.

## Developer Documentation

This documentation is intended for business owners and site administrators of Spree e-commerce sites. Everything you need to know to configure and manage your Spree store can be found here.

If you are a Spree developer, you may find the [Developer Guides](/developer) to be of benefit to you, though we strongly urge you to read through both sets of guides.
